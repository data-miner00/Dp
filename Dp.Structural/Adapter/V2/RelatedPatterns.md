### Bridge

Bridge separates interface from implementation; Adapter changes the interface of an existing object.

### Decorator

Decorator changes an object without changes its interface; Adapter changes the interface of an existing object.

### Facade

Facade defines a new interface with an entire subsystem; Adapter makes an existing interface usable via wrapping.

### Proxy

Defines a surrogate for another object, but does not change its interface
